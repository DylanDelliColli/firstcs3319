-- check to ensure CASCADE delete worked properly
SELECT * FROM Doctors;
SELECT * FROM Is_Assigned;
-- delete did not work properly since it was deleted from both tables

-- delete any doctors who are Surgeons
DELETE FROM Doctors WHERE specialty LIKE "Surgeon";

-- check to see if delete worked
SELECT * FROM Doctors;
SELECT * FROM Is_Assigned;
-- the delete command didn't work because there exists a surgeon who is a head doctor therefore they are a foreign key and cannot be deleted
